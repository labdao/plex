You shouldn't have to spend days researching and setting up BioML tools.

Get started in less than 5 minutes, with best-in-class tools for Small Molecule Binding and Protein Folding - plus more coming soon!

## Introducing PLEX
PLEX is a library that allows you to run BioML tools direct from your command line, without having to worry about failing dependencies or managing compute.

[Install PLEX here with 1 line of code](/getting-started/install-plex)

## In the docs:
In these docs, you can find:

- Curated, best-in-class pipelines for important drug discovery tasks
- Containerized tools you can run straight away
- Step-by-step guides for the tools we support

## What to do next

- [Install PLEX here with 1 line of code.](/getting-started/install-plex)


- Run a tool - check out our [Small Molecule Binding](../small-molecule-binding/overview) or [Protein Folding](../protein-folding/overview) toolsets. For example, our small molecule binding toolset includes a workflow for docking small molecules & proteins, and for visualizing the results. **You can install PLEX, run an example model, and visualize the results in less than 5 mins!**

- Find out more about our tools on our [website](https://labdao.xyz/tools).

- Get involved! If you'd like to help us containerize tools, or you want to explore a scientific collaboration, [you can get involved here](../about-us/mission.md).

## About PLEX

PLEX is a library built upon [Bacalhau](https://docs.bacalhau.org/) that allows you to easily run BioML models for a wide range of applications. It is written in Go.

When you run a tool, Plex requests compute-time from members of the LabDAO network, so you don’t have to worry about hardware requirements or setting up the necessary compute infrastructure.

## PLEX is maintained by LabDAO

LabDAO is an online organisation of scientists and engineers. 

Our goal is to make BioML tools more accessible and clinically relevant. 

We aim to unlock progress in the field, by breaking down barriers caused by poor usability and niche expertise.

You can learn more in the [About Us](../about-us/mission.md) section.
